# Computational Model of a HAN-based Satellite Thruster
By Team HAN Solo


Contained here are the final Jupyter Notebook and supporting files of the team's attempt to model the use of HAN as a fuel for a rocket engine. The final notebook is under the title: 

      "Computational Model of the Decomposition of HAN in a Rocket Engine Chamber"
      
The following packages are necessary to run the notebook:

      numpy
      cantera
      scipy
      matplotlib
      ipywidgets
      display
      seaborn
      
Additional files that are needed to run the program are:

      HAN.cti

Previous iterations of the notebook can be found in the master, 120719_su, and 120812_rd branches. The team initially started working on modeling the reaction in the master branch under HAN_Main_Notebook. The reaction mechanics, thrust, and specific impulse sections were completed and optimized in the 120719_su branch. The sensitivity analysis was performed in the 120812_rd branch. These two parts were put together in the final notebook, as stated above to be "Computational Model of the Decomposition of HAN in a Rocket Engine Chamber".
